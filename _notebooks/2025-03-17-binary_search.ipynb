    "## What is Binary Search?  \n",
    "Binary Search is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that efficiently finds a target value in a **sorted list** by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (Step-by-Step)  \n",
    "1. **Ensure the list is sorted** before performing a binary search.  \n",
    "2. **Set pointers**:  \n",
    "   - `low = 0` → Start of the list.  \n",
    "   - `high = len(arr) - 1` → End of the list.  \n",
    "3. **Loop until `low > high`**:  \n",
    "   - Find the **middle index**:  \n",
    "     - mid = (low + high)/2\n",
    "   - Compare the middle element with the target:  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] == target` → **Return the index** (found!).  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] < target` → **Search right half** (update `low = mid + 1`).  \n",
    "     - If `arr[mid] > target` → **Search left half** (update `high = mid - 1`).  \n",
    "4. If the target is not found, return `-1`. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Code (Python)\n",
    "### Iterative Implementation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search(arr, target):\n",
    "    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n",
    "    \n",

    "numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n",
    "print(binary_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the function**  \n",
    "   - The function is defined to take two parameters:\n",
    "     - `arr`: a sorted list to search in.\n",
    "     - `target`: the value you're looking for in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def binary_search(arr, target):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set the search range**  \n",
    "   - Two pointers are used: `low` starts at index 0, and `high` starts at the last index (`len(arr) - 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat while the range is valid (`low <= high`)**  \n",
    "   - This loop continues as long as there is a valid portion of the list left to search.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while low <= high:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the middle index**  \n",
    "   - `mid = (low + high) // 2` gives the middle index between `low` and `high`.\n",
    "   - Integer division (`//`) ensures the result is a whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check if the middle element is the target**  \n",
    "   - If `arr[mid] == target`, we found it! Return `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if arr[mid] == target:\n",
    "    return mid  # Target found\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **If the target is greater than the middle element**  \n",
    "   - Move the search to the right half by updating `low = mid + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   elif arr[mid] < target:\n",
    "    low = mid + 1  # Search right half\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **If the target is less than the middle element**  \n",
    "   - Move the search to the left half by updating `high = mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "    high = mid - 1  # Search left half\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **If the loop ends and no match was found**  \n",
    "   - Return `-1` to indicate the target is not in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return -1  # Target not found\n",
