# What is Digital Divide?

 - The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals, communities, or countries with access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) and those without.
 - It includes disparities in internet access, availability of devices, and digital literacy.
Two main dimensions:
 - Access – Availability of internet and digital devices.
 - Usage – How people utilize technology effectively.


# Factors Contributing to the Digital Divide

### Economic Disparities

 - Cost of Technology: Many low-income individuals and families cannot afford computers, smartphones, or internet services.
 - Limited Access to Education & Job Opportunities: Without technology, individuals may struggle to develop digital skills needed for higher-paying jobs.
 - Schools in wealthier areas have better funding for technology, such as computers, smartboards, and coding programs.
 - Many low-income individuals lack access to online banking, digital payment platforms, and financial management tools.

### Educational Disparities
 - Unequal Access to Technology in Schools: Schools in wealthier areas have better funding for technology, such as computers, smartboards, and coding programs.
 - Students in well-funded schools receive early exposure to coding, STEM programs, and digital tools, giving them a competitive edge.
 - Wealthier students could continue learning through virtual tutoring, online courses, and personal computers, widening the gap

### Geographic Disparities

 - Rural-Urban Divide – Urban areas have better digital infrastructure compared to rural and remote locations.
 - Infrastructure Limitations – Remote areas may lack broadband networks due to high costs.
 - Educational Barriers – Students in rural areas face challenges in accessing online learning tools.

### Impacts of the Digital Divide
 - Affects access to education, jobs, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
 - Worsens existing social and economic inequalities.
 - Slows down technological innovation and global economic development.

### The Digital Divide in San Diego
 - San Ysidro, about 40% of households lack a wireline broadband subscription (sandiego.gov).
 - High concentrations of low-income households without broadband are found in City Heights (16%), San Ysidro (17%), National City (18%), and Barrio Logan/Logan Heights (21%) (sandag.org).
