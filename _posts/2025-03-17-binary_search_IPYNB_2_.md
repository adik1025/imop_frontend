# Binary Search Algorithms

## What is Binary Search?  
Binary Search is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that efficiently finds a target value in a **sorted list** by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)  
1. **Ensure the list is sorted** before performing a binary search.  
2. **Set pointers**:  
   - `low = 0` â†’ Start of the list.  
   - `high = len(arr) - 1` â†’ End of the list.  
3. **Loop until `low > high`**:  
   - Find the **middle index**:  
     $
     \text{mid} = \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2}
     $
   - Compare the middle element with the target:  
     - If `arr[mid] == target` â†’ **Return the index** (found!).  
     - If `arr[mid] < target` â†’ **Search right half** (update `low = mid + 1`).  
     - If `arr[mid] > target` â†’ **Search left half** (update `high = mid - 1`).  
4. If the target is not found, return `-1`.

## Time Complexity  
| Case         | Time Complexity |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Best Case** | `O(1)` (Found in the first check) |
| **Worst Case** | `O(log n)` (Keeps halving the search space) |
| **Average Case** | `O(log n)` |

ðŸ”¹ **Why is Binary Search Fast?**  
Each step **eliminates half of the remaining elements**, making it significantly faster than **Linear Search (`O(n)`)**, especially for large datasets.

## Binary Search Code (Python)
### Iterative Implementation:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2  # Find middle index
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1  # Search right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1  # Search left half
    
    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
print(binary_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 3
```

## Edge Cases to Consider with Binary Search
1. **Empty List (`[]`)** â†’ Returns `-1` (nothing to search).  
2. **One Element List** (`[5]`)** â†’ Works if target matches.  
3. **Target Not in List** â†’ Returns `-1`.  
4. **Target at First or Last Position** â†’ Should be handled efficiently.  
5. **Even vs. Odd-Length Lists** â†’ Works in both cases, but index calculations may differ slightly.  
6. **Duplicate Elements** â†’ Might need modifications to return the first/last occurrence.  
7. **Integer Overflow (in some languages)** â†’ Using `(low + high) // 2` might cause overflow. Use `low + (high - low) // 2`.  

## Binary Search vs. Linear Search

| Feature                  | Binary Search (`O(log n)`)        | Linear Search (`O(n)`)           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Requirement**     | Must be **sorted**                | Can be unsorted                  |
| **Speed on Large Data**  | Very Fast                         | Slow                             |
| **Best Use Case**        | Large sorted lists                | Small or unsorted lists          |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Slightly complex             | Simple                           |
| **Worst Case Scenario**  | `O(log n)`                        | `O(n)`                           |
| **Memory Usage**         | `O(1)` (iterative) or `O(log n)` (recursive) | `O(1)`                  |

## Popcorn Hack 2

Which of these best describes the approach used by Binary Search?

```
a) Checking each element sequentially  
b) Splitting the search space in half each time  
c) Jumping randomly to different indices  
d) Sorting the array before searching
```

What is the worst-case time complexity of Binary Search?

```
a) O(n)  
b) O(n log n)  
c) O(log n)  
d) O(1)  
```

Why must the array be sorted before applying Binary Search?

```
a) To ensure that duplicate values are removed  
b) So that the middle element can be meaningfully compared  
c) Because sorting improves the search speed to O(1)  
d) It is not necessary; Binary Search works on any list
